# Hi, I'm Zheyue! üëã

Welcome to my GitHub Pages.

This space showcases my personal projects in automation, data workflows, and applied legal tech.  
I'm currently building lightweight tools that solve real-world problems I encountered during legal internships and data work.

## Featured Projects

- [FL160_AutoFiller](./FL160_AutoFiller)  
  A lightweight form-filling prototype using Python and Jinja2, designed to simplify legal document workflows.
- [AI Consumer Trend Dashboard](./AI-Consumer-Trend-Dashboard)
  A visualization of overall AI keyword popularity
- [Social Buzz Analysis](./social-buzz-analysis)  
  A data-driven project analyzing **user behavior and content performance** on the Social Buzz dataset.  
  Key outcomes include:  
  - Identifying **temporal hot zones** (seasonality & daily rhythms)  
  - Highlighting **replicable high-quality content** (e.g., Culture)  
  - Detecting **risky ‚Äúviral illusion‚Äù topics** (e.g., Technology, Healthy Eating)  
  - Generating **recommendations for scalable content investment**  

## About Me

I'm passionate about bridging tech and real-world operations‚Äîespecially in environments with limited resources.  
My background spans data pipelines, document automation, and system optimization.
