# Social Buzz Analysis

This project analyzes user reactions and content performance for **Social Buzz**, a fictional social media startup preparing for its IPO.  
The goal is to identify **which content categories are worth replicating**, **which ones are risky to invest in**, and **what strategies can maximize user engagement**.  

## Key Highlights

- Jupyter / Google Colab  

## Results (at a glance)
- ✅ **Culture**: High score, stable, scalable → Recommended for replication.
